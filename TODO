**-for shopping list, make it inceremental, if users selects 1 plan now, then came back and selected another plan or recipe, so to have a total shopping cart to be sent to the shopping api.

**-can we add a feature to select the country for the user so the recipes can as much closer to the common ingredients we can find in that specifc country?

for admin dashboard:
recipe genetaing Success Rate Tracking: Track how often validation passes
Admin Dashboard: See ai recipe/meal plan, shopping list generating validation failure patterns

- the front page, should be the progress, and from there depending on what you lack then you ask the Ai to generate a new meal. recipe, or plan. or create a recommendations.
the tracking charts and stats should be redesigned: to have an overall score, then a chart for the 5 defence system coverage, the 5 foods for each system, and the 5 times the calculation should reflect that in away, also the date selection shoud be daily, weekly, and monthly, and smart recommendation or each view.

- the whole tracking page to be redesigned to shows a recommendations based on the actual progress,
 for example: when you click on the home page, the header should be reminder for user why this is important.
then the tracker, should have a recommendation to create a recipe or plan based on the status,  the whole flow should be as a sequesnce of actions. create recipe/plan> create shopping list> purchase> log to track... with notifciations sent if any step hasnt been completed.
- based on the status, the smart recommendation system will take in consideration the user history, current status and recommend to create meal plan or a recipe, the date shoud be send to the geneartor if the user agree, link the home page with the meal plan generator and the recipe generators.

- rearrange the nav bar, meal plannin rename it to more friendly one, move it before the recipes.
- meal plan, make the options for each step drop down list, with a default selected option for each.
- have the dietry preference as part of the user preferences, and to be a default for their meal plan and recipe generators
