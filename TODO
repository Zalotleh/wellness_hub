Plan for nextjs 15 Later:

Next.js 15 Migration Scope
✅ API routes: Already compatible (using await)
❌ 20+ page files need refactoring (params/searchParams)
❌ React 18 → 19 upgrade required
❌ next-auth React 19 compatibility unclear
⚠️ Estimated effort: 4-8 hours of work + testing
The Safe Path

Next.js 15: Plan for Q2 2025
When you're ready:

Allocate 1-2 days for migration
Run the codemod: npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest
Manually fix the 20+ files with params/searchParams
Update React to 19
Thorough testing across all features
My advice: Patch to 14.2.35 today (takes 5 minutes), then schedule the Next.js 15 upgrade for when you have proper time to test everything. Security first, features second.

Other fixes:
- ✅ FIXED (Dec 27, 2025): Manual recipe creation UX - Merged Steps 1 & 2 into two-column Recipe Setup. Key Foods on left, live ingredients on right. Simplified from 4 steps to 3 steps (Recipe Setup → Instructions → Review).
- ✅ FIXED (Dec 27, 2025): Recipe review step - Fixed critical bug where form was submitting after Step 2, skipping Step 3 (Review). Now users MUST go through Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 (Review) before submission. Added success screen with 3-second delay after submission. Users can properly review their complete recipe before creating/updating.
- add imgae to the recipe, manual recipe generator. can we for AI recipe generator?

- when user is logged, and goes to home page, he is recirected to the home page before signing in, is uer is signed in, then should be redirected to the recipes page, or create another hom age for signed in users.

- in a saved meal plan, in the day view, user can add a new breakfast, new launch, , new dinner, what if we rename this to Add new Meal or snack instead, as users can add whatever they want?

- in the saved meal plan, in the day view, if i click on the ... to copy meal,edit, delete the meal, the drop dwon menu is having the same recipe card view, which means that if teh menu card is short(small vertically) then part of the menu will not show as it is hidden behind the page's backgound.

- in the meal plan generator page, the defense system information message which shows on hovering over the defense system, show vertically,the text is wrapped vertically, like 2 words in each line, can we have better UI for it?
- when user signs out they are redirected to this url: https://your-domain.com/login
- create pages: ABout, FAQ, contact, cookie policy, blog or community? add community link to the footer
- are we using pgae: app/(dashboard)/pdf-test/page.tsx?
-  integrate shopping api
-password change implementation, check files: docs/PASSWORD_QUICK_START.md and docs/PASSWORD_RESET_FEATURE.md
- email smpt provider setting for password and notifications.

Idea for revenue instead of subscription, provide initial credits for users to use, create recipes, use all features using this credits, and they can top it up based on their preferences and usage. based on researc and best marekting and revenue generating strategse in the market, which strategy is better and why?
- if the idea of the credit is calidated then we need to calculate how much credit a user can use to generate certain amouunt of recipes, ai advices, meal plans .. etc, calculate the cost of these generatinons, then calculate the cost for each credit and how much user can consume from these credits and decuct as well other costs, stripee, hosting, db, analytics, smpt, domain .. etc, and also think about how other features as an exmaple community perks can be ifluences by this credit system, the permium and family features in community are listed as below:
