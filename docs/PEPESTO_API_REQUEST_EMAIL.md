## Email Draft:

Dear Pepesto Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am the developer of **Wellness Hub**, a comprehensive meal planning and nutrition platform currently in active development.

### About Wellness Hub

Wellness Hub is a holistic wellness application built on the **5x5x5 Defense System** (5 meals, 5 days, 5 defense systems), helping users plan nutritious meals, track their progress, and maintain healthy eating habits. Our platform includes:

- AI-powered meal plan generation
- Custom recipe management
- Nutritional tracking across 5 defense systems (Protein, Fiber, Vitamins, Hydration, Minerals)
- Shopping list automation
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Community features

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL  
**Target Markets:** Initially Europe (with future global[Your Email]  
[Your Phone Number - if applicable]  
[Website/Demo Link - if available]   expansion)  
**Current Status:** Active development with functional meal planning and shopping list features

### Why We're Interested in Pepesto

After reviewing various grocery shopping APIs, Pepesto stands out as the ideal solution for our European user base for several reasons:

1. **Geographic Coverage**: Your support for 11 European countries aligns perfectly with our initial target markets
2. **Comprehensive API**: The ability to parse recipes, match products, and automate checkout in a single platform
3. **AI-Powered Automation**: Your AI agent approach reduces integration complexity and improves user experience
4. **Revenue Sharing**: The referral commission model creates a sustainable partnership opportunity
5. **Quality Focus**: Your emphasis on health-conscious supermarkets (Whole Foods equivalent) matches our wellness-focused user base

### Our Integration Plan

We plan to implement Pepesto's API in phases:

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
- Use `/parse` endpoint to structure our existing recipes
- Implement `/products` endpoint for ingredient-to-product matching
- Display matched products with prices and images in shopping lists

**Phase 2 (Short-term):**
- Integrate `/session` endpoint for one-click cart creation
- Implement user billing flow with referral markup
- Add multi-country/supermarket selection

**Phase 3 (Medium-term):**
- Explore `/checkout` automation via WebView for mobile app
- Integrate `/suggest` for AI recipe recommendations
- Implement catalog tracking for price comparison features

### Use Case Example

A typical user flow in Wellness Hub would be:
1. User generates a 5-day meal plan using our AI generator
2. System automatically creates shopping list from meal plan recipes
3. **Pepesto integration**: User clicks "Shop Now" → sees matched products from their local supermarket with real prices
4. User reviews cart, makes adjustments, and completes checkout via Pepesto's automation
5. We earn referral commission, user gets seamless experience

**Estimated API Volume:**
- Initial: 50-100 API calls/day during beta testing
- 6 months: 500-1,000 calls/day with growing user base
- 12 months: 2,000-5,000 calls/day at scale

### Request for API Access

I would like to request API access to begin integration development and testing. Specifically:

1. **API Key** for development and testing purposes
2. **Onboarding documentation** and integration best practices
3. **Test mode or sandbox environment** if available
4. **Pricing guidance** for our expected usage patterns
5. **Partnership opportunities** as we grow our European user base

### Questions

- Do you offer a test/sandbox environment for development?
- What is the typical onboarding timeline?
- Are there volume discounts for scaled usage?
- Do you provide technical support during integration?
- Are you open to design partnership for feature co-development?
